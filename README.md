# .config

These are my sane configs. Copy them into your ~/.config folder. You'll need to make sure the software that uses these configs points to their location in ~/.config and not ~. The simplest way to do that is to use symlinks. For example, for maven, symlink ~/.config/maven to ~/.m2, which is where maven looks for configs.
