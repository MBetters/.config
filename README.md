# configs

These are my sane configs. To clone them, run `git clone --recursive https://github.com/MBetters/configs.git`. The simplest way to get your system's software to use these configs is to use symlinks. For example, for maven, if ~/.m2 already exists, then delete it and symlink /path/to/configs/maven to ~/.m2.
